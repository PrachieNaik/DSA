/**
WAP to find the Missing Number in array.

Assuptions: Only positive numbers, Unsorted array

Method 1: The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Now find the
sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value of the missing element. However, there can be 
overflow if n is large. In order to avoid integer overflow, pick one number from known numbers and subtract one number from given numbers. This way there won’t 
have Integer Overflow ever.

/**

Method 2: This method uses the technique of XOR to solve the problem.  
XOR has certain properties:
Assume a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ …^ an = a and a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ …^ an-1 = b
Then a ^ b = an
time complexity: O(N), auxiliary space complexity O(1)
