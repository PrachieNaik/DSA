/*

Given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion.
Note: this solution will only work for distinct elements.



Method 1: First sort the array. After sorting, exclude the first element, swap the remaining elements in pairs. (i.e. keep arr[0] as it is, swap arr[1] and arr[2],
swap arr[3] and arr[4], and so on). 

Time complexity: O(N log N) since we need to sort the array first.



Method 2: The idea is to use a modified one pass of bubble sort.

Maintain a flag (or check for odd-even index) for representing which order(i.e. < or >) currently we need. If the current two elements are not in that order then 
swap those elements otherwise not. 
Suppose we are processing B and C currently and the current relation is ‘<‘, but we have B > C. Since current relation is ‘<‘ previous relation must be ‘>’ i.e.,
A must be greater than B. So, the relation is A > B and B > C. We can deduce A > C. So if we swap B and C then the relation is A > C and C < B. Finally we get the 
desired order A C B 

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
