/*

Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. 
An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 

Method 1 (Use Sorting) : Sort both strings, Compare the sorted strings
	Time Complexity: O(nLogn), Space Complexity: O(1)

Method 2 (count characters using one array) : In this method, it is assumed that the characters are stored using 8 bit and there can be 256 possible characters. 
	Create count array of size 256. Initialize all values in count array as 0. Increment the value in count array for characters in str1 and decrement for 
	characters in str2. Finally, if all count values are 0, then the two strings are anagram of each other. 
	Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1) [auxiliary array of 256 characters]

Method 3 (Taking sum) : Initialize a variable say count to 0. Take the sum of all the characters of the first String and then decreasing the value of all the 
	characters from the second String. If the Count value finally is 0 then its an anagram, else it is not.
	Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(1)
