Problem statement: Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before
v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

The approach is based on the below fact:

A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.

Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest
path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred 
then S would not have been the longest path => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

Algorithm: Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:
Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
        Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
        Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
        If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
        
Step 5: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 6: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(V+E).
The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will be executed E number of times.
Auxillary Space: O(V).
The queue needs to store all the vertices of the graph. So the space required is O(V)
