Problem statement: Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.

Approaches:

Method 1: The idea is very basic run a nested loop, the outer loop which will mark the starting point of the subarray of length k, the inner loop will run from the starting index to index+k, k elements from starting index and print the maximum element among these k elements. 

    Complexity Analysis: 
    
    Time Complexity: O(N * K). 
    The outer loop runs n-k+1 times and the inner loop runs k times for every iteration of outer loop. So time complexity is O((n-k+1)*k) which can also be written as O(N * K).
    Space Complexity: O(1). 
    No extra space is required.
    
Method 2: This method uses Max-Heap to solve the above problem. The elements of the current window will be stored in the Max-Heap and the maximum element or the root will be printed in each iteration. 
    Max-heap is a suitable data structure as it provides constant-time retrieval and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum elements in it, i.e. it takes constant time to find the maximum element and insertion and deletion takes log n time. 

    Algorithm: 

    Pick first k elements and create a max heap of size k.
    Perform heapify and print the root element.
    Store the next and last element from the array
    Run a loop from k – 1 to n 
    Replace the value of element which is got out of the window with new element which came inside the window.
    Perform heapify.
    Print the root of the Heap.
    
    Complexity Analysis: 

    Time Complexity: O(n * k). 
    The time complexity of steps 4(a) is O(k), 4(b) is O(Log(k)) and it is in a loop that runs (n – k + 1) times. Hence, the time complexity of the complete algorithm is O((k + Log(k)) * n) i.e. O(n * k).
    Space Complexity: O(k). 
    To store the elements in Heap O(k) space is used.

Method 3: This method uses Deque to solve the above problem. Create a Deque, Qi of capacity k, that stores only useful elements of current window of k elements. An element is useful if it is in current window and is greater than all other elements on right side of it in current window. Process all array elements one by one and maintain Qi to contain useful elements of current window and these useful elements are maintained in sorted order. The element at front of the Qi is the largest and element at rear/back of Qi is the smallest of current window.

    Algorithm: 
    Create a deque to store k elements.
    Run a loop and insert first k elements in the deque. Before inserting the element, check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element , if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
    Now, run a loop from k to end of the array.
    Print the front element of the deque.
    Remove the element from the front of the queue if they are out of the current window.
    Insert the next element in the deque. Before inserting the element, check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element , if it is so remove the element from the back of the deque, until all elements left in the deque are greater than the current element. Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
    Print the maximum element of the last window.

    Complexity Analysis: 
    
    Time Complexity: O(n). 
    It seems more than O(n) at first look. It can be observed that every element of array is added and removed at most once. So there are total 2n operations.
    Auxiliary Space: O(k). 
    Elements stored in the dequeue take O(k) space.
