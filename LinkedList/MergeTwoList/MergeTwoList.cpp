/*

Given two sorted lists, merge them so as to produce a combined sorted list (without using extra space).

Constraints: 0 <= N <= 50
1 <= Mi <= 20
1 <= Element of linked list <= 10^3

Approaches:

Method 1:
    The recursive solution can be formed, given the linked lists are sorted.
    
    Compare the head of both linked lists.
    Find the smaller node among the two head nodes. The current element will be the smaller node among two head nodes.
    The rest elements of both lists will appear after that.
    Now run a recursive function with parameters, the next node of the smaller element and the other head.
    The recursive function will return the next smaller element linked with rest of the sorted element. Now point the next of current element to that, i.e curr_ele->next=recursivefunction()
    Handle some corner cases.
    If both the heads are NULL return null.
    If one head is null return the other.

    Time complexity:O(n).
    Only one traversal of the linked lists are needed.
    Auxiliary Space:O(n).
    If the recursive stack space is taken into consideration.

Method 2:
    
    This approach is very similar to the above recursive approach.

    Traverse the list from start to end.
    If the head node of second list lies in between two node of the first list, insert it there and make the next node of second list as the head. Continue this until there is no node left in both lists, i.e. both the lists are traversed.
    If the first list has reached end while traversing, point the next node to the head of second list.
    Note: Compare both the lists where the list with smaller head value is the first list.
    
    Time complexity:O(n).
    As only one traversal of the linked lists is needed.
    Auxiliary Space:O(1).
    As there is no space required.
