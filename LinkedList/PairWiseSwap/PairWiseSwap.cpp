/*

Problem statement: Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to swap elements in the linked list pairwise.

Sample Input: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7 

Sample Output: 2->1->4->3->6->5->7

Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3

Basic case: 1
Advance case: 1->2->3->4
Edge case: 1, 1->2
No input case: NA

Approaches:

Brute Force: Start from the head node and traverse the list. While traversing swap data of each node with its next node’s data.
	Time Complexity: O(N)
	Space Complexity: O(1)

Optimized: If data contains many fields, there will be many swap operations. So changing links is a better idea in general.
	Time Complexity: O(N)
	Space Complexity: O(1)
