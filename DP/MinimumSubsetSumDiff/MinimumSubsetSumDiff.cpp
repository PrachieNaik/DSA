Problem statement: Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 
    If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11

Approach: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming when the sum of the elements is not too big. We can create a 2D array dp[n+1][sum+1] where n is a number of elements in a given set and sum is the sum of all elements. We can construct the solution in a bottom-up manner.

    The task is to divide the set into two parts. 
    We will consider the following factors for dividing it. 
    Let dp[n+1][sum+1] = {1 if some subset from 1st to i'th has a sum equal to j             0 otherwise}
        
        i ranges from {1..n}
        j ranges from {0..(sum of all elements)}  
    
    So      
        dp[n+1][sum+1]  will be 1 if 
        1) The sum j is achieved including i'th item
        2) The sum j is achieved excluding i'th item.
    
    Let sum of all the elements be S.  
    
    To find Minimum sum difference, w have to find j such 
    that Min{sum - j*2  : dp[n][j]  == 1 } 
        where j varies from 0 to sum/2
    
    The idea is, sum of S1 is j and it should be closest
    to sum/2, i.e., 2*j should be closest to sum.

Time Complexity = O(n*sum) where n is the number of elements and sum is the sum of all elements.
