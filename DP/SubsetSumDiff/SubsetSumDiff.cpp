Problem statement: Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is equal to given difference. 
    If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) equal to given difference.

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} , diff = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:

Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11   
diff = 1

Subset1 = {5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 11
Subset2 = {1, 11}, sum of Subset2 = 12 
diff = 1

Approach: This problem can be reduced to find the number of subsets with sum equal to X.
    s1 - s2 = diff , s2 = sum - s1
    s1 - (sum - s1) = diff
    s1 = (diff + sum) / 2
Count the number of subsets whose sum is s1.
