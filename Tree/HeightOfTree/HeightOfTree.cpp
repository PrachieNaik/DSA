Problem statement: Given a binary tree, find its height.

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= Data of a node <= 10^5


Approach:

    Recursively calculate height of left and right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus

    Algorithm: 
    maxDepth()
    1. If tree is empty then return 0
    2. Else
         (a) Get the max depth of left subtree recursively  i.e., 
              call maxDepth( tree->left-subtree)
         (a) Get the max depth of right subtree recursively  i.e., 
              call maxDepth( tree->right-subtree)
         (c) Get the max of max depths of left and right 
              subtrees and add 1 to it for the current node.
             max_depth = max(max dept of left subtree,  
                                 max depth of right subtree) 
                                 + 1
         (d) Return max_depth
    
	Time Complexity: O(n)
	Space Complexity: O(1)
