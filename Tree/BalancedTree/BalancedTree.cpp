/*

Problem statement: Given a binary tree, find if it is height balanced or not. A tree is height balanced if difference between heights of left and right subtrees is not more than one for all nodes of tree. 

Constraints:
1<= N <= 104

Approach: To check if a tree is height-balanced, get the height of left and right subtrees. Return true if difference between heights is not more than 1 and left and right subtrees are balanced, otherwise return false. Calculate the height in the same recursion rather than calling a height() function separately. 
     
Time complexity â€“ O(n)
