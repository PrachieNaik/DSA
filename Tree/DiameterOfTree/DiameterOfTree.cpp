/*

Problem statement: Given a Binary Tree, find diameter of it.
The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two end nodes in the tree. The diagram below shows two trees each with diameter nine, the leaves that form the ends of a longest path are shaded (note that there is more than one path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 10000
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000

Approach: Diameter of a tree can be calculated by only using the height function, because the diameter of a tree is nothing but maximum value of (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node. So we need to calculate this value (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node and update the result. 
     
    Time complexity â€“ O(n)

/* Function to find height of a tree */
int height(Node* root, int& ans)
{
    if (root == NULL)
        return 0;
 
    int left_height = height(root->left, ans);
 
    int right_height = height(root->right, ans);
 
    // update the answer, because diameter of a
    // tree is nothing but maximum value of
    // (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node
    ans = max(ans, 1 + left_height + right_height);
 
    return 1 + max(left_height, right_height);
}
 
/* Computes the diameter of binary tree with given root. */
int diameter(Node* root)
{
    if (root == NULL)
        return 0;
    int ans = INT_MIN; // This will store the final answer
    height(root, ans);
    return ans;
}
