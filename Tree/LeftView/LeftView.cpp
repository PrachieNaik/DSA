Problem statement: Given a Binary Tree, print left view of it. Left view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is visited from left side.

Constraints:
0 <= Number of nodes <= 100
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000

Approaches:

Method-1 (Using Recursion)

	The left view contains all nodes that are first nodes in their levels. A simple solution is to do level order traversal and print the first node in every 
	level. The problem can also be solved using simple recursive traversal. We can keep track of the level of a node by passing a parameter to all recursive 
	calls. The idea is to keep track of the maximum level also. Whenever we see a node whose level is more than maximum level so far, we print the node because
	this is the first node in its level (Note that we traverse the left subtree before right subtree). 

	Time Complexity: The function does a simple traversal of the tree, so the complexity is O(n). 
	Auxiliary Space: O(n), due to the stack space during recursive call.  

Method-2 (Using Queue):

	In this method, level order traversal based solution is discussed. If we observe carefully, we will see that our main task is to print the left most node 
	of every level. So, we will do a level order traversal on the tree and print the leftmost node at every level.

	Time Complexity: O( n ), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
	Auxiliary Space: O(1)
